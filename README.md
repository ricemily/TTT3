Description:  The goal of this project is a to create a tic tac toe program with artificial intelligence so that the computer will win whenever possible and at the least tie.  It is written in Java and has a graphical interface.

Resources:  Tic tac toe theory was taken from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe (Wikipedia).  Miscellaneous online resources were also consulted for drawing needs and a graphical layout, as well as a chapter from a textbook on drawing in Java. 

Proper Usage:  Choose the "move first" radio button or "move second" radio button.  Then click on Start.  If you choose "move first," you move first.  If you choose "move second," the computer will move first and start with an "O" on the upper left corner square. Then it's your turn.
